# Prediction of T cell type based on TCR beta chain sequences using Convolutional Neural Networks

This repo contains the code and the report of a final project for the course **Algorithms for Bioinformatics** held at the Technical University of Denmark, Lyngby, by professor Morten Nielsen.  The paper produced during the project can also be found in the repo.

 
### Description
T helper and T killer cells are two different type of T cells and are differentiated on their
expression of either CD4 or CD8 molecules. In this study, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are applied to predict the type of T cell
based on the beta chain sequence of the T cell receptor (TCR).
